		<h1>Alana Candela</h1>
		<p>
			I am a senior at Oswego graduating in May with a degree in marketing with a graphic design minor. In my free time I like to illustrate on Adobe Illustrator and paint. I work at the telefund for SUNY Oswego and I also have a digital marketing internship right now. I have never taken a class like Web Media, but I am excited to learn!
